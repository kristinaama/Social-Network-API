  ## Description:
 The objective of this application is to create an API for social networking. The API consists of users, user's friends, thoughts, and reactions to the thoughts. The goal is to create a web application in which a user can create, update, and delete friends on their list. They can post, delete, and update thoughts, and each friend can react to those thoughts. The below criteria was kept in mind when creating this application:

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

  ## Installation:
 The code can be downloaded via the Social Network API folder on my Github page.

  ## Usage:
  This Social Network API is intended for easy navigation by using the command line interface. The user begins by typing 'npm start' in the command line. The user can interact with the API endpoints by using Insomnia or running it on local host.
